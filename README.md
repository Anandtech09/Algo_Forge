## Features

- **Problem Catalog**: A curated list of 40 coding problems covering topics like arrays, linked lists, trees, dynamic programming, graphs, and more.
- **Interactive Dialog**: A React-based dialog component (`ProblemDialog`) to display problem details, including:
  - Problem title, difficulty, and category.
  - Estimated time and points for solving.
  - Detailed problem description.
  - Toggleable solution code in Python with example usage.
  - Tips and hints for solving the problem.
  - Able to download completed problems
- **DSA Community**: Users can create posts , chat with other developers at realtime
- **Responsive UI**: Built with modern UI components (e.g., Dialog, ScrollArea, Badge) for a seamless user experience.
- **Extensible**: Easily add new problems by updating the `dataStructure.json` file and corresponding solutions in the `ProblemDialog` component.

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: React, TypeScript
- **UI Components**: Custom UI library (`@/components/ui/*`) with components like Dialog, Button, ScrollArea, and Badge
- **Icons**: Lucide React (`lucide-react`)
- **Data**: JSON-based problem definitions
- **Solutions**: Python code snippets for each problem
